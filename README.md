# Deep-Convolutional-Q-Learning-Pac-Man

## Description

This model consists of adding to Deep Q-Learning a Convolutional Neural Network so that our AI can see images, which will be the inputs of the whole Neural Network.

Once the Neural Network, composed of first a Convolutional Neural Network and followed by a fully-connected Neural Network is build, next the model will be trained play Pac-Man, this famous game of our childhood.

## Requirements 
 Google Colab       
 [Gymnasium Documentation Pacman](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/atari/pacman/)      
 PyTorch   
 
## Environment Description

A classic arcade game. Move Pac Man around a maze collecting food and avoiding ghosts- unless you eat a Power Pellet, then you can eat the ghosts too!

## Actions
Pacman has the action space of Discrete(5) with the table below listing the meaning of each actionâ€™s meanings. To enable all 18 possible actions that can be performed on an Atari 2600, specify full_action_space=True during initialization or by passing full_action_space=True to gymnasium.make.   

<b>Value</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;   <b>Meaning</b>      
 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOOP        
 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UP      
 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RIGHT       
 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEFT      
 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DOWN    

 ## Variant Used
 <ul>
   <li>MsPacmanDeterministic-v0</li>
 </ul>

 Detereministic means that the monsters will be deterministic to make the environment less complex, and v0 is the initial version release.
